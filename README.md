# Voice-Based-Virtual-Assistant-using-python

The objective of this project is to implement a virtual personal assistant using Python that is cost-effective and secure.
The system will operate on voice commands, making human interaction with computer more efficient through Artificial Intelligence

## Algorithms
ops.py: This module contains the speech engine, which listens, recognizes, and displays usersâ€™ speech instructions.
online_ops.py: This module has the code for online operations that the virtual assistant performs.
offline_ops.py: This module has the code for offline operations performed by the virtual assistant.
main.py: This is the driver module of the project.
utils.py and.env: These modules are the configuration modules that store the information required for the bot.
movie_database.py: It is a small database that contains the details of demo movies for the movie booking feature of the virtual assistant.
